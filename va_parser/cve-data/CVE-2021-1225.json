    "title": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system. These vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface improperly validates values in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating to the application and sending malicious SQL queries to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify values on or return values from the underlying database or the operating system.",
