    "title": "A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the way IOBit Advanced SystemCare Ultimate 14.2.0.220 driver handles Privileged I/O write requests. During IOCTL 0x9c40a0dc, the first dword passed in the input buffer is the device port to write to and the word at offset 4 is the value to write via the OUT instruction. The OUT instruction can write one byte to the given I/O device port, potentially leading to escalated privileges of unprivileged users. A local attacker can send a malicious IRP to trigger this vulnerability.",
