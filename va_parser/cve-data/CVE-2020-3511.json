    "title": "A vulnerability in the ISDN subsystem of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when the ISDN Q.931 messages are processed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious ISDN Q.931 message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the process to crash, resulting in a reload of the affected device.",
