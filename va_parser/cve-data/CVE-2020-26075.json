    "title": "A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco IoT Field Network Director (FND) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain access to the back-end database of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of REST API requests that are made to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious API requests to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to the back-end database of the affected device.",
