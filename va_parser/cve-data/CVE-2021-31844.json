    "title": "A buffer overflow vulnerability in McAfee Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Endpoint for Windows prior to 11.6.200 allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges through placing carefully constructed Ami Pro (.sam) files onto the local system and triggering a DLP Endpoint scan through accessing a file. This is caused by the destination buffer being of fixed size and incorrect checks being made on the source size.",
