    "title": "A vulnerability has been identified in SIEMENS LOGO!8 (6ED1052-xyyxx-0BA8 FS:01 to FS:06 / Firmware version V1.80.xx and V1.81.xx), SIEMENS LOGO!8 (6ED1052-xyy08-0BA0 FS:01 / Firmware version < V1.82.02). An attacker with network access to port 10005/tcp of the LOGO! device could cause a Denial-of-Service condition by sending specially crafted packets. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the affected service. No user interaction is required to exploit this security vulnerability. Successful exploitation of the security vulnerability compromises availability of the targeted system. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.",
