    "title": "wimpy_trackplays.php in Plaino Wimpy MP3 Player, possibly 5.2 and earlier, allows remote attackers to insert arbitrary strings into trackme.txt via the (1) trackFile, (2) trackArtist, and (3) trackTitle parameters, which can result in providing false information about songs, occupying excessive disk space with very long parameter values, and storing executable code that might be invoked through a different vulnerability.  NOTE: since this issue, as described by the original researcher, is entirely dependent on the presence of another vulnerability, it could be argued that Wimpy cannot be responsible for how its data file is processed by applications outside of its control. Since this issue might only be useful as a facilitator manipulation in another vulnerability, perhaps it should not be included in CVE.",
