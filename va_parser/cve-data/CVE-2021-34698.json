    "title": "A vulnerability in the proxy service of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust system memory and cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper memory management in the proxy service of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a large number of HTTPS connections to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the system to stop processing new connections, which could result in a DoS condition. Note: Manual intervention may be required to recover from this situation.",
