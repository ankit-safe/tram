    "title": "loolforkit is a privileged program that is supposed to be run by a special, non-privileged lool user. Before doing anything else loolforkit checks, if it was invoked by the lool user, and refuses to run with privileges, if its not the case. In the vulnerable version of loolforkit this check was wrong, so a normal user could start loolforkit and eventually get local root privileges.",
