In February 2019, attackers have actively exploited this in the wild to download and execute ransomware payloads on all endpoints managed by the VSA server. If the ManagedIT.asmx page is available via the Kaseya VSA web interface, anyone with access to the page is able to run arbitrary SQL queries, both read and write, without authentication.",
