    "title": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Commvault CommCell 11.22.22. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the Demo_ExecuteProcessOnGroup workflow. By creating a workflow, an attacker can specify an arbitrary command to be executed. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-13889.",
