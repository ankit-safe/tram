    "title": "The Jetpack Scan team identified a Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability in the Patreon WordPress plugin before 1.7.0, allowing attackers to make a logged in user overwrite or create arbitrary user metadata on the victim\u2019s account once visited. If exploited, this bug can be used to overwrite the \u201cwp_capabilities\u201d meta, which contains the affected user account\u2019s roles and privileges. Doing this would essentially lock them out of the site, blocking them from accessing paid content.",
