    "title": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of D-Link DAP-2020 v1.01rc001 Wi-Fi access points. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the processing of CGI scripts. When parsing the errorpage request parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose stored credentials, leading to further compromise. Was ZDI-CAN-11856.",
