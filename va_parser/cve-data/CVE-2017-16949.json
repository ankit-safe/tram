Improper input sanitization allows the attacker to override the settings for allowed file extensions and upload file size, related to inc/cores/file-uploader.php and file-uploader/file-uploader-class.php. This allows the attacker to upload anything they want to the server, as demonstrated by an action=ap_file_upload_action&allowedExtensions[]=php request to /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php that results in a .php file upload and resultant PHP code execution.",
