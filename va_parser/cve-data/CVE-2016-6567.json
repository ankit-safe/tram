The Resident Download Manager does not verify that the firmware is authentic before executing code and deploying the firmware to devices. A remote attacker with the ability to send UDP traffic to the device may be able to execute arbitrary code on the device. According to SHDesigns website, the Resident Download Manager and other Rabbit Tools have been discontinued since June 2011.",
