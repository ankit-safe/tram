    "title": "A vulnerability in Cisco DNA Spaces: Connector could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a command injection attack and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as root. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments passed to a specific CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input during the execution of the affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as root.",
