    "title": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AppDynamics Controller Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access a configuration file and the login page for an administrative console that they would not normally have authorization to access. This vulnerability is due to improper authorization checking for HTTP requests that are submitted to the affected web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected instance of AppDynamics Controller. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the login page for an administrative console. AppDynamics has released software updates that address this vulnerability.",
