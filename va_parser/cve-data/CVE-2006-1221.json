    "title": "Untrusted search path vulnerability in the TrueVector service (VSMON.exe) in Zone Labs ZoneAlarm 6.x and Integrity does not search ZoneAlarms own folders before other folders that are specified in a users PATH, which might allow local users to execute code as SYSTEM by placing malicious DLLs into a folder that has insecure permissions, but is searched before ZoneAlarms folder.  NOTE: since this issue is dependent on the existence of a vulnerability in a separate product (weak permissions of executables or libraries, or the execution of malicious code), perhaps it should not be included in CVE.",
