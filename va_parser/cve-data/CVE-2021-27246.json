    "title": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of TP-Link Archer A7 AC1750 1.0.15 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of MAC addresses by the tdpServer endpoint. A crafted TCP message can write stack pointers to the stack. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the root user. Was ZDI-CAN-12306.",
