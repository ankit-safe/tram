    "title": "A vulnerability in Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrator privileges to overwrite or read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system (OS) of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation in NFVIS filesystem commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using crafted variables during the execution of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite or read arbitrary files on the underlying OS.",
