    "title": "A vulnerability in Cisco Enterprise Network Functions Virtualization Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrator privileges to overwrite files on the underlying operating system (OS) of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation in an NFVIS file-system command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using crafted variables during the execution of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the underlying OS.",
