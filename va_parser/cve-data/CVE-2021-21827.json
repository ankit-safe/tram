    "title": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the XML Decompression DecodeTreeBlock functionality of AT&T Labs Xmill 0.7. Within `DecodeTreeBlock` which is called during the decompression of an XMI file, a UINT32 is loaded from the file and used as trusted input as the length of a buffer. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.",
