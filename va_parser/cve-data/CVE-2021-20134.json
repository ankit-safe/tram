    "title": "Quagga Services on D-Link DIR-2640 less than or equal to version 1.11B02 are affected by an absolute path traversal vulnerability that allows a remote, authenticated attacker to set an arbitrary file on the routers filesystem as the log file used by either Quagga service (zebra or ripd). Subsequent log messages will be appended to the file, prefixed by a timestamp and some logging metadata. Remote code execution can be achieved by using this vulnerability to append to a shell script on the routers filesystem, and then awaiting or triggering the execution of that script. A remote, unauthenticated root shell can easily be obtained on the device in this fashion.",
