In versions up to and including 0.3.1 there is a heap-based out of bounds write in parse_die() when reversing an AMD64 ELF binary with DWARF debug info. When a malicious AMD64 ELF binary is opened by a victim user, Rizin may crash or execute unintended actions. No workaround are known and users are advised to upgrade.",
