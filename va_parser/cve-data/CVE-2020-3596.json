    "title": "A vulnerability in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of incoming SIP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of SIP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust memory on an affected device, causing it to crash and leading to a DoS condition.",
