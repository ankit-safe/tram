    "title": "A vulnerability in ICMP Version 6 (ICMPv6) processing in Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a slow system memory leak, which over time could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to improper error handling when an IPv6-configured interface receives a specific type of ICMPv6 packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sustained rate of crafted ICMPv6 packets to a local IPv6 address on a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a system memory leak in the ICMPv6 process on the device. As a result, the ICMPv6 process could run out of system memory and stop processing traffic. The device could then drop all ICMPv6 packets, causing traffic instability on the device. Restoring device functionality would require a device reboot.",
