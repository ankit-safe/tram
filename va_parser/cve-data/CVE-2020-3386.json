    "title": "A vulnerability in the REST API endpoint of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with a low-privileged account to bypass authorization on the API of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization of certain API functions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the API using low-privileged credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions through the REST API with administrative privileges.",
