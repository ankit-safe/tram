    "title": "The file transfer component of TIBCO Software Inc.s TIBCO Managed File Transfer Platform Server for IBM i contains a vulnerability that theoretically allows an attacker to perform unauthorized network file transfers to and from the file system accessible to the affected component. This vulnerability is exploitable when the configuration option Require Node Resp is set to No. In the event of a successful exploit, the attacker could theoretically read and write any file on the file system accessible to the affected component, thus fully affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the operating system hosting the deployment of the affected system. Affected releases are TIBCO Software Inc.s TIBCO Managed File Transfer Platform Server for IBM i: versions 7.1.0 and below, version 8.0.0.",
