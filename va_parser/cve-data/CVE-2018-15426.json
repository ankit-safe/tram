    "title": "A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Unity Connection could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based interface of the affected software. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the web-based interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.",
