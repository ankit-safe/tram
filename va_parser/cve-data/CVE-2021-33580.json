    "title": "User controlled `request.getHeader(Referer)`, `request.getRequestURL()` and `request.getQueryString()` are used to build and run a regex expression. The attacker doesnt have to use a browser and may send a specially crafted Referer header programmatically. Since the attacker controls the string and the regex pattern he may cause a ReDoS by regex catastrophic backtracking on the server side. This problem has been fixed in Roller 6.0.2.",
