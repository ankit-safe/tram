    "title": "A vulnerability in the remote management feature of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to inject arbitrary commands and potentially gain elevated privileges. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of commands to the remote management CLI of the affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary commands and potentially gain elevated privileges.",
