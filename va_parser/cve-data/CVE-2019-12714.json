    "title": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IC3000 Industrial Compute Gateway could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly manages system resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening a large number of simultaneous sessions on the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition of the web-based management interface, preventing normal management operations.",
