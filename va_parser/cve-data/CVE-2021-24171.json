    "title": "The WooCommerce Upload Files WordPress plugin before 59.4 ran a single sanitization pass to remove blocked extensions such as .php. It was possible to bypass this and upload a file with a PHP extension by embedding a blocked extension within another blocked extension in the wcuf_file_name parameter. It was also possible to perform a double extension attack and upload files to a different location via path traversal using the wcuf_current_upload_session_id parameter.",
