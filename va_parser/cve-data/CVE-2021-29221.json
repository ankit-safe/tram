    "title": "A local privilege escalation vulnerability was discovered in Erlang/OTP prior to version 23.2.3. By adding files to an existing installations directory, a local attacker could hijack accounts of other users running Erlang programs or possibly coerce a service running with erlsrv.exe to execute arbitrary code as Local System. This can occur only under specific conditions on Windows with unsafe filesystem permissions.",
