    "title": "Southsoft GMIS 5.0 is vulnerable to CSRF attacks. Attackers can access other users private information such as photos through CSRF. For example: any students photo information can be accessed through /gmis/(S([1]))/student/grgl/PotoImageShow/?bh=[2]. Among them, the code in [1] is a random string generated according to the users login related information. It can protect the users identity, but it can not effectively prevent unauthorized access. The code in [2] is the student number of any student. The attacker can carry out CSRF attack on the system by modifying [2] without modifying [1].",
