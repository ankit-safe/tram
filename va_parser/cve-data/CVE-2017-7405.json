    "title": "On the D-Link DIR-615 before v20.12PTb04, once authenticated, this device identifies the user based on the IP address of his machine. By spoofing the IP address belonging to the victims host, an attacker might be able to take over the administrative session without being prompted for authentication credentials. An attacker can get the victims and routers IP addresses by simply sniffing the network traffic. Moreover, if the victim has web access enabled on his router and is accessing the web interface from a different network that is behind the NAT/Proxy, an attacker can sniff the network traffic to know the public IP address of the victims router and take over his session as he wont be prompted for credentials.",
