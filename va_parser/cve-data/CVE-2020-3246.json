    "title": "A vulnerability in the web server of Cisco Umbrella could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a carriage return line feed (CRLF) injection attack against a user of an affected service. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to access a crafted URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into valid HTTP responses sent to the browser of the user.",
