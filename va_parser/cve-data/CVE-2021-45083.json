Two of those files contain some sensitive information that can be exposed to a local user who has non-privileged access to the server. The users.digest file contains the sha2-512 digest of users in a Cobbler local installation. In the case of an easy-to-guess password, its trivial to obtain the plaintext string. The settings.yaml file contains secrets such as the hashed default password.",
