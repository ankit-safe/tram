Customers are only affected by this issue if they previously selected \u201cEnable Encryption\u201d in the ShareFile configuration page and did not re-select this setting after running the CTX269106 mitigation tool. ShareFile customers who have not run the CTX269106 mitigation tool or who re-selected \u201cEnable Encryption\u201d immediately after running the tool are unaffected by this issue.",
