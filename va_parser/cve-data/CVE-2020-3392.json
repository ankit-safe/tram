    "title": "A vulnerability in the API of Cisco IoT Field Network Director (FND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly authenticate API calls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending API requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information on the affected system, including information about the devices that the system manages, without authentication.",
