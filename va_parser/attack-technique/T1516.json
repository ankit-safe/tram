    "description": "A malicious application can inject input to the user interface to mimic user interaction through the abuse of Android's accessibility APIs.\n\n[Input Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1516) can be achieved using any of the following methods:\n\n* Mimicking user clicks on the screen, for example to steal money from a user's PayPal account.(Citation: android-trojan-steals-paypal-2fa)\n* Injecting global actions, such as `GLOBAL_ACTION_BACK` (programatically mimicking a physical back button press), to trigger actions on behalf of the user.(Citation: Talos Gustuff Apr 2019)\n* Inserting input into text fields on behalf of the user. This method is used legitimately to auto-fill text fields by applications such as password managers.(Citation: bitwarden autofill logins)",
