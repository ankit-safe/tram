Adversaries may use the information from [System Information Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1426) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not to fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions. \n\n \n\nOn Android, much of this information is programmatically accessible to applications through the `android.os.Build` class.

Typically, applications will only be able to query the device model and which version of iOS it is running. ",
