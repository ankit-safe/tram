This bait is visible to the attacker and alerts security teams when they have taken the bait. Security teams can then cut off access and investigate the attacker\u2019s behaviour. Companies use these tools to allow hackers into their systems to monitor their behaviour with the goal of better understanding their navigation paths, operational mechanisms, and targets. In effect, this software helps provide the company with information on vulnerabilities by offering a better understanding of threat vectors and vulnerabilities of their own systems, applications, and networks.\n\nDeception technology products are typically standalone solutions purpose-built for deception and investigation.
