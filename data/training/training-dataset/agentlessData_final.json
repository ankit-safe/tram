Large networks with hundreds or thousands of nodes are difficult to manage without a large staff to monitor every computer. SNMP, which is widely used in local area networks (LANs), allows to monitor network nodes from a management host. It also allows to monitor network devices such as servers, workstations, printers, routers, bridges, and hubs, as well as services such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or Windows Internet Name Service (WINS).SNMPv3 provides much improved security over previous versions by offering options for Authentication and Encryption of messages. When configuring a user for SNMPv3 you have the option of using a range of encryption schemes, or no encryption at all, to protect messages in transit. AES128 is the minimum strength encryption method that should be deployed.",
